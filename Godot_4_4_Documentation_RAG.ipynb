        "\n",
        "This project provides a pre-built vector database for the Godot Engine 4.4 documentation. This database can be used to perform fast and efficient similarity searches on the entire Godot documentation, making it a powerful tool for developers looking for information, code examples, or tutorials.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is a Vector Database?\n",
        "\n",
        "A vector database is a type of database that stores and indexes data as high-dimensional vectors. In the context of natural language processing, these vectors represent the semantic meaning of text. By converting the Godot documentation into a vector database, we can perform searches based on the meaning of the query, rather than just keywords. This allows for more intuitive and powerful searches. For example, you could search for \"how to make a character jump\" and get relevant results even if the exact phrase doesn't appear in the documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How was this database created?\n",
        "\n",
        "This vector database was created using the following process:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Cloning the Documentation:** The official Godot Engine 4.4 documentation was cloned from its GitHub repository.\n",
        "2. **Parsing .rst Files:** All of the `.rst` (reStructuredText) files in the documentation were parsed and converted into plain text.\n",
        "3. **Chunking:** The entire text of the documentation was split into smaller chunks of 1000 characters with a 200-character overlap. This is done to ensure that the context of each chunk is preserved.\n",
        "4. **Embedding:** Each chunk of text was then converted into a high-dimensional vector using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence transformer model. This model is a state-of-the-art model that is optimized for creating sentence and paragraph embeddings.\n",
        "5. **Storing in ChromaDB:** The resulting vectors were then stored in a ChromaDB database. ChromaDB is an open-source vector database that is easy to use and can be run locally.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to use this database\n",
        "\n",
        "To use this database, you will need to have Python installed, along with the following libraries:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `langchain`\n",
        "* `langchain-community`\n",
        "* `langchain-huggingface`\n",
        "* `sentence-transformers`\n",
        "* `chromadb`\n",
